# X.js

An insanely small mv* framework! It's meant to simplify the process of working with data and client/server interaction. Don't repeat yourself - be DRY!

## Installation

X.js is highly dependent on jQuery (>1.5.0) and some functionality is dependent on Underscore.js (or Lo-Dash).

For normal use, include the before mentioned dependencies and then either [x.js](build/x.js) or a minified version â€” [x.min.js](build/x.min.js).

---

For Node.js users, it's a matter of the following:

```sh
$ npm install x-js
```

Then to work with it:

```javascript
var $ = require('jquery'); // Important!
var _ = require('underscore'); // Optional but awesome...
var X = require('x-js');
```
